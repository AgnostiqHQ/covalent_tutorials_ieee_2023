    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CHSH inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality) is an important result related to [Bell’s theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem), which shows that quantum mechanics is incompatible with [local hidden-variable theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden-variable_theory). This means that there are results in quantum mechanics (see the [Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Podolsky%E2%80%93Rosen_paradox)) which cannot be explained by some unknown parameters that are local to the system being observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are simple experiments on quantum computers that can show violation of the CHSH inequality. These experiments involve running computations on systems of *entangled* qubits. With Covalent QElectrons and free access to IBM Quantum backends, we can easily do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The CHSH Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical systems that ************are************ compatible with local hidden variables must obey the following inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\langle S_{\\mp} \\rangle| = |\\langle AB \\rangle  \\mp \\langle Ab \\rangle \\pm \\langle aB \\rangle + \\langle ab \\rangle| \\leq 2 \\qquad (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\langle \\, \\cdot \\, \\rangle$ refers to the expectation value of some observable. The value $\\langle AB \\rangle$, for example, is the average outcome of an experiment involving an $A$-basis measurement on the first qubit and a $B$-basis measurement on the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the CHSH inequality requires two *different* measurement bases for each qubit, or four two-qubit measurement bases for the entire system. In our experiment, we take $b$ and $B$ to be the Pauli $Z$ and $X$ bases, while $a$ and $A$ taken to be the bases $Z^\\prime$ and $X^\\prime$. Crucially, the latter two are rotated (in the same plane) by some angle $\\theta$ relative to $Z$ and $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Demonstration of Bell’s Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here will be to verify that the CHSH inequality $(1)$ is violated by a quantum system of two entangled qubits.\n"

    "\n",
    "This will involve the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the two-qubit system in a [Bell state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state).\n",
    "2. Apply $Y$-rotation by an angle $\\theta$ to the first qubit only.\n",
    "3. Measure the system in the $ZZ$, $ZX$, $XZ$,  or $XX$ basis.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1-3 many times to estimate the expectation value.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 1-4 to obtain estimates for all four bases which are used to compute  $\\langle S_{\\mp} \\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $Y$-rotating the first qubit before measurement is equivalent here to measuring that qubit in a *rotated basis.* Therefore, the expectation values we obtain are indeed the $\\langle Z^\\prime Z \\rangle$, $\\langle Z^\\prime X \\rangle$, $\\langle X^\\prime Z \\rangle$,  and $\\langle X^\\prime X \\rangle$ required to compute $|\\langle S_{\\mp} \\rangle|$."

    "Briefly, the state $|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle$ is said to be “maximally entangled” because measuring either qubit will determine the measurement outcome of the other with perfect accuracy (when both qubits are measured in the same basis). This is easy to verify by looking at the basis states that make up $|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "State preparation is straightforward. Starting with the $|00\\rangle$ state, applying a Hadamard on the first qubit, followed by a CNOT gate produces $|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle$. We also apply an additional $Y$-rotation of the first qubit by $\\theta$ to control offset between the respective measurements."
